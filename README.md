Hipster Bird is an arcade style Android game where a hipster bird thinks he's cool and decides to fly the opposite direction his friends are flying.

I used to sell this full version of the game on Google Play for $0.99 but have unpublished it and now the free version only lasts.

The store listing of the free version can be found here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gamicarts.hipsterbirdfree&hl=en

The game was released in November 2014.
